# GANDALF-1.0
Hi beautiful!  
If you want to run this application, you need to follow a few simple steps

First of all, don't forget about dependencies.  
After that you need to run frontend application with the command **npm run build**.   
Then build backend with **npm run build**.
And the last one: run backend with the command **npm run start**.

Congratulations, this is all you need to do, the application will be rebuilt and the page will reload after any new changes you make.
